# Todo Project

This is a simple Todo project implemented with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the Document Object Model (DOM). The project allows users to create, update, and delete tasks in a todo list.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add new tasks to the todo list.
- **Update Task:** Users can mark tasks as complete or update the task description.
- **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks from the todo list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Task data is stored in the browser's local storage for persistence across page reloads.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-project.git
   
# Project Structure

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the todo list.
- **style.css:** The CSS file for styling the todo list.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file for handling user interactions and manipulating the DOM.
- **README.md:** Documentation for the todo project.

# Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Use the following features:

   - **Add Task:** Type a task in the input field and click the "Add Task" button.
   - **Update Task:** Click on a task to mark it as complete. Double-click on a task to update its description.
   - **Delete Task:** Click on the "Delete" button next to a task to remove it from the list.
